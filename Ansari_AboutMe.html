          <p style="margin:50px;">  Hello, I am Meilad Ansari 14-year-old. 9th grader at DHS. In CSP with Mr.Brown 2nd period. I love coding. In the future, my goal is to become a hardware Engineer or Software Engineer. As a student in CSP with Mr.Brown, my thoughts toward becoming a software Engineer becomes more and more. I have a set goal where I wouldn't change my Career. I have a big passion for programming. </p>
          <break></break>
          <p style="margin:50px;">  The characteristics/experience I need to have to be working as a Software Engineer is Organized, Serious and Knowledgeable. I need to be Organized because so I can find things easier and quicker to get the job done. I need to be serious because the need to focus on the task I am working on. Lastly, I need to be knowledgeable because to learn new things as time passes by. I have to be knowledgeable to understand new things I get. A few major achievements I need to accomplish during my years attending DHS is to become a member of an Engineering club and to have a 3.5 GPA above. A couple of months passed and I am working with code more and more every day, I have learned that I am capable of coding in HTML and CSS. I can start my own little company where I can make people's websites.
             </p>
