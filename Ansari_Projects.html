        <p style="text-align:center">For this project, we were supposed to make an app that could have been a game or a trivia type of app. So, my partner and I Sanjana J decided that we are going to do a trivia app where we can ask the user's company logos pictures and they have to guess what the logo. There was a 10-sec timer. When the 10 sec is up, it would make a sad trombone sound. This project took 2-3 weeks to finish. We had a beta and final walk to show our peers what we have done and get some feedback. We got good feedback from our class and some improvement feedback. From this project, my partner and I learned how team-work and design/code can make a functional app. This project was assigned on September 23 and due on October 5. The Mini Beta Gallery Walk: 09/30. The Project app Deadline: 10/05 The Final Gallery Walk: 10/08. In this project, I have learned that working with a group could be less stressful and they are your group mates that can help you when needed. One challenge that I and my partner faced is that our timer didn't count down from 10 to 0 then it would make a sad trombone sound. I learned as a creator that the stress and the fun you go while making an app. </p>

        <p style="text-align:center">For this project, we were supposed to
          create a family picture frame for a client. So, my partner and I Styles S decided that we were going to pick four family photos off google and then make a 2x2 brown picture frame to insert the pictures. This project took about a week to complete. We had a virtual final gallery walk due to the school closure. We got feedback on what we need to improve. 
          From this project, my partner and I learned how to use team-work skills and both of our knowledge in programming and designing. This assignment was assigned on March 16, 2020, and due on April 3, 2020. The virtual gallery walk was on April 1, 2020. In this project, I have learned that working with a partner could be less stressful also your partner could guide you when needed. One challenge that my partner and I faced was collecting all of the images and inserting them in our 2x2 frame. I learned as a programmer that while doing a project there are lots of ups and downs. You need to be flexible with everything.   </p>
